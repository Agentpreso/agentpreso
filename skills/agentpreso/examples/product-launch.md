# Beacon

Intelligent monitoring that sees problems before your users do.

---

<!-- _class: focus -->

## Every minute of downtime costs the average SaaS company $5,600.

Most teams find out about outages from angry customer tweets -- not their monitoring tools.

<!-- _class: bullets -->

## What Makes Beacon Different

- Predictive alerting powered by anomaly detection
  - Catches degradation patterns 15 minutes before they become incidents
- Zero-config auto-discovery of your entire stack
  - Agents map services, dependencies, and data flows automatically
- Plain-language incident summaries
  - No more deciphering cryptic error logs at 3 AM
- One-click root cause analysis
  - Trace any issue from symptom to source across all services

## Before vs. After Beacon

::: left

### Without Beacon

- Alert fatigue: 200+ noisy alerts per day
- MTTR of 47 minutes on average
- Engineers on-call dread their rotation
- Post-mortems reveal the same gaps
- Monitoring config is a full-time job

:::

::: right

### With Beacon

- Smart alerts: 5-10 actionable signals per day
- MTTR reduced to 8 minutes
- On-call confidence with guided remediation
- AI-generated post-mortems with action items
- Auto-discovery means zero config maintenance

## How It Works

1. **Install the agent** -- A single lightweight binary auto-discovers your services, databases, queues, and external dependencies in under two minutes

2. **Beacon learns your baseline** -- Machine learning models build a profile of normal behavior across all your metrics, logs, and traces over a 24-hour calibration period

3. **Get predictive alerts** -- When Beacon detects drift from baseline, it alerts your team with a plain-language summary and suggested remediation steps

4. **Resolve with context** -- One-click root cause analysis traces the issue across services and provides a timeline of exactly what changed and when
